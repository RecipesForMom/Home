On your hands and knees with a dedicated floor sponge, and a spray bottle of vinegar. 

In Japan, [people clean the floors in their apartments by hand.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-vbm9ShZWE) In the U.S., people with small kitchens might not realize that this approach saves time and effort. You don't need to fill a bucket or even wear gloves. Just wipe up the crud that spilled when you cooked dinner last night with a sponge and vinegar. If you do this regularly enough, your kitchen floor will stay clean enough that you don't have to do anything else. If that's not enough for you, you can use a steam mop to clean without using chemicals.
