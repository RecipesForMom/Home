Ingredients:
* 1 onion (plus oil to sauté)
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 tbsp chili powder
* 1/2 tbsp ground cumin
* large pinch oregano
* 2 heaping cups dried black beans
* 6 cups broth<sup>1</sup> or water (or just fill until water is a few centimeters above the beans) 
* 4 small fresh tomatoes
* spring onion for garnish
* sour cream for garnish
* salt to taste
* optional<sup>2</sup>

Instructions:
* Chop the onion and brown in the bottom of the pressure cooker.
* [Peel garlic]({% post_url 2017-05-09-how-to-peel-garlic %}) roughly chop once or twice.<sup>3</sup> Add all of the ingredients to pot *except the tomatoes and garnishes.* Seal the lid, and max out the heat on your burner to bring to pressure. Once pressure is reached, turn down the heat to just below medium and cook for 20 minutes. 
* After 20 minutes, use your favorite method of releasing the pressure or if you're busy with stuff, come back when everything has cooled. After releasing pressure, throw in the chopped fresh tomatoes and spring onions and bring to a boil for a few seconds to cook it a bit, and serve!

1. I'll often use water and a heaping spoonful of high quality bouillon such as the Better Than Bouillon brand or some vegan bouillon cubes from Whole Foods. It saves time/ metal opening a can and keeps in the fridge indefinitely.
2. Add cilantro, or avocado slices for garnish, or a couple slices of bread to dip into the soup. If you like more heat, dice a few jalapeños or chillies and toss in with the beans. If you like more zest, squeeze some lime juice in at the end. If you like more savory, add chorizo or meat of your choice after you sauté the onion, or add shredded cheese at the end. If you like more vegetables, toss in a roughly chopped carrot or celery before bringing to pressure.
3. Pressure cooked garlic has no texture so don't worry about mincing garlic.
