Regular latex gloves from your general merchandise retailer get pin prick holes after a few weeks of wear.

The boutique rubber gloves made of vinyl are thick and bulky, often lined with cotton that gets mildewy without proper care and vinyl production leeches carcinogens into the environment.

The solution, *nitrile gloves* from the hardware store. I didn't think they would last a year ago. Now, I use them every day and they are lightweight, don't get mildewy, and best of all: no holes. Thanks, dad, for finding this!
