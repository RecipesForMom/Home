This recipe is based off of the [Ezo Gelin Çorbası](http://almostturkish.blogspot.com/2006/09/ezo-bride-soup-ezo-gelin-orbas.html) from the Almost Turkish blog.  

Ingredients: 

* 1 onion chopped and oil to sauté
* 1 cup red lentils
* 1 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 tbsp pepper paste or paprika<sup>1</sup>
* 3 cloves of garlic loosely chopped
* 1 tbsp dried mint
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* broth to cover by about 2 cm
* salt and pepper to taste
* optional: 1/4 c bulgur

Instructions:

* Brown onion in oil in the bottom of your pressure cooker. Turn off heat and add lentils, tomato paste, pepper paste, garlic, mint, oregano, and broth or water and bullion till it covers ingredients by 2 cm. Bring to pressure and cook for 3 minutes, release pressure. Optionally add bulgur and let sit in hot soup for 5 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste. 



1. We often have paprika at home, but not pepper paste so I make this cheater's substitution.
