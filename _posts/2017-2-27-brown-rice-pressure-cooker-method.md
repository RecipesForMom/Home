Ingredients:

* 1 cup of brown rice
* 1.5 cup of water

Instructions:

* Add ingredients to pressure cooker.<sup>1</sup> Bring to pressure and turn down heat. Cook for 5 minutes. Let sit for 10 minutes before releasing pressure (or let pressure release naturally if you're busy).<sup>2</sup>

1. A small pressure cooker reaches pressure faster. I use my grandmother's 5 quart and an [Indian 3 liter by Hawkins.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MPQH8U/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
2. The rice will look a bit wet when you open the lid. Stir and the excess moisture will evaporate.
