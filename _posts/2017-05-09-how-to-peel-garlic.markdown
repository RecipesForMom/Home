I peel garlic in three ways: Italian grandmother, Korean grandmother, or lazy garlic press method.

* Italian grandmother: Whack your garlic with a pestle or any heavy intrument from your kitchen tools. The garlic is slightly crushed. The peel slips off.

* Korean grandmother: Press your garlic with the flat side of your big kitchen knife. The garlic is slightly crushed. The peel slips off.

* Lazy garlic press method: When you get down to the little center cloves that would be tedious to peel save them for the times you are using crushed garlic. Then put the cloves directly in the press, and remove leftover peels before pressing the next round.
