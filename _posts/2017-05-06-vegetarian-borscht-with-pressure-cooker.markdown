This recipe is a modification of the [Classic Ukrainian Borscht Recipe](http://natashaskitchen.com/2010/09/26/classic-russian-borscht-recipe/) from Natasha's Kitchen where I cut the cooking time in half by pre-cooking the beets in the pressure cooker.

Ingredients:
* 4 beets
* 3 yellow potatoes
* 1 onion (plus oil to sauté)
* 1 small red cabbage
* 3 bay leaves
* 10 cups water or water-broth mix<sup>1</sup> (or fill to cover vegetables)
* 3 carrots grated
* 5 tbsp ketchup
* 4 tbsp lemon juice
* 1 bunch dill
* salt and pepper to taste
* sour cream for garnish

*The beets are already in the pressure cooker!*

Instructions:
* Wash and pressure cook the beets for 7-10 minutes (measured after pressure is reached). Save the water. You will add it back to the soup slowly, discarding the last bit with the dirt in it.
* Chop and sauté an onion in oil. Chop and add the potatoes. Put the red cabbage through the slicer on the food processor and add. Add bay leaves and broth to cover and bring to a boil. 
* Put the carrots through the grater on the food processor. The pre-cooked beets should be easy to peel and slice. Once the potatoes are tender, add the carrots and pre-cooked beets and add the beet water slowly, being careful not to pour in any sediment. 
* Add the ketchup and chopped dill. Turn off the heat and add the lemon juice and serve  with sour cream.

1. I'll often use water and a heaping spoonful of high quality bouillon such as the Better Than Bouillon brand (substitute water or vegan bouillon for vegan version). It saves time/ metal opening a can and keeps in the fridge indefinitely.
