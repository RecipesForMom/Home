This is inspired by [Larb Gai](http://shesimmers.com/2009/06/how-to-make-larb-gai-lahb-gai-laab-gai-larp-gai-laap-gai-lahb-gai-%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%9A%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%81%E0%B9%88.html) from She Simmers. However, it's more like a cross between Larb Gai and Holy Basil Chicken. 

Ingredients:

* 1 lb ground chicken 
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and chopped, plus oil to sauté
* 1/4 c fish sauce
* 1/4 c lime juice plus more for adding afterwards to taste
* 1 jalepeño
* 1 large package of basil or 3 of the 1 oz packages you can find in most grocery stores with the leaves picked off of the stems

Instructions:

* Sauté the chopped garlic in some oil. Add the ground chicken and cook until it's done. Chop half of the basil. Then add 1/4 cup fish sauce and the chopped basil and cook some more. Turn off the heat and add 1/4 cup lime juice. 

* Serve over rice with fresh basil leaves and chopped jalapeño on top. Bring extra lime juice to the table for people who like it sour.
