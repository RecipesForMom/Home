Ingredients:

* 1/4 c tahini
* 1 lemon's worth (2 tbsp) of lemon juice<sup>1</sup>
* 1-2 cloves fresh garlic pressed
* 1/4 c water

Instructions:

* Whip the tahini and lemon juice in a bowl with a fork until it forms an emulsion. Then add water and pressed garlic, mix and serve over salad or steamed kale.

1. I squeeze the lemon directly into the bowl with tahini over a small strainer. This saves time fishing out lemon seeds.
