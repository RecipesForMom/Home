This recipe is created by our friends Jenny and Michael. 

Ingredients:

* 2 cups (or more) leftover rice
* Leftover grocery store rotisserie chicken pieces picked off the bone
* Leftover grocery store rotisserie chicken carcass boiled for at least an hour to make broth
* 1 package mushrooms, chopped (and oil to sauté)
* 3 tbsp butter and 3 tbsp flour for a roux
* leftover veggies from the fridge, chopped
* whatever shredded cheese you have

Instructions: 

* Heat oven to 375°. Grease a baking dish and add rice, chicken, and chopped vegetables.

* In a pan, sauté mushrooms in a bit of oil. Melt butter into pan, add flour and mix a bit. Then add two cups of the chicken broth that you just made with the carcass. Boil until the roux thickens. 

* Pour mushroom broth over the baking dish, top with shredded cheese, and bake for about 45 minutes or until the cheese browns on the top.
