Before watching YouTube, my first experience making curry/ Indian food was from Joe Grossberg's ["How to Make a Simple Curry 'Anything'"](http://www.joegrossberg.com/archives/002047.html) recipe. I really like the idea: Curry is a sauce. Learn to make the sauce and use it on anything you happen to have in the fridge or cupboard. 

The principle of Joe Grossberg's recipe is the following:

* fry your cumin
* fry your onion
* fry your ginger garlic chili paste
* fry your spices (cumin, coriander, cayenne, turmeric)
* deglaze the pan with pureed tomatoes and boil till it forms a thick sauce

This works well for Indian people who keep a [3g box](http://bhavnaskitchen.com/3gs-ginger-garlic-and-green-chillies/) in their fridge for cooking every night. 3g stands for chopped ginger, garlic, and green chili. 

The principle of frying aromatics and spices first is still the tastiest method of making curry and my preference given time. However, I don't keep a 3g box in my fridge. Prepping ginger, garlic, chili and tomatoes makes curried recipes take over an hour to cook. A shortcut used in some YouTube recipes is to puree the aromatics with the tomatoes and then fry. 

Here is my Curried Anything: Cheater's Method Version 1:

Ingredients:

* 2 inches fresh ginger peeled [peeled]({% post_url 2017-05-09-how-to-peel-ginger %})
* 5 cloves fresh garlic [peeled]({% post_url 2017-05-09-how-to-peel-garlic %})
* 3 small tomatoes
* 1 green chili or 1/2 tsp red cayenne powder (or more to taste)

* 1 tsp whole cumin seeds and oil to saut√©

* 1 tbsp coriander powder
* 1 tsp turmeric powder
* salt to taste

Instructions:
* Put the tomatoes, garlic, ginger, chili and all of the spices minus the cumin (coriander, turmeric, paprika, cayenne powder) in the food processor to puree. Fry the cumin in oil. Add the spicy tomato puree, and cook until the oil comes to the top. Salt to taste.
