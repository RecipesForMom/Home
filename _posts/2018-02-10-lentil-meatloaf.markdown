This recipe is stolen from The Spruce's [Easy Vegan/Gluten-Free Lentil Loaf](https://www.thespruce.com/vegan-lentil-loaf-recipe-3377145). The only modification I've made is to cook the lentils in the pressure cooker. 

Ingredients:
* 2 cups leftover cooked rice (whatever kind you've got, or make a cup [in the pressure cooker]({% post_url 2017-02-27-brown-rice-pressure-cooker-method %}))
* 1 1/2 cups lentils (green or brown)
* 3 cups water (or chicken broth if you're not a vegetarian)
* 2 onions diced and oil to sauté
* 2 cloves of garlic minced

* 1/4 cup ketchup
* 1 teaspoon sage
* 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (or mix up equal parts oregano, thyme, rosemary, marjoram, and basil as I do)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt (or salt to taste)

Instructions:

* Pressure cook the lentils in the broth/water for ten minutes. Ideally, let the pressure release naturally while you do other things. The lentils need to be mushably soft. 

* Sauté the onions in another pan. Add chopped garlic when onions begin to brown and sauté for another minute.

* Poor out excess liquid from the lentils. Add the leftover rice, onion garlic mixture, and seasonings. Mash the mixture around to break up some of the lentils and form a mush. Grease a baking dish, press the mixture in, coat the top with ketchup, and bake for an hour. 

Note: In the future I might try sautéing the onions and garlic in the bottom of the pressure cooker before adding the lentils to use less pans.
