This recipe is based off of [Dan Buettner's Ikarian Longevity Stew,](https://bluezones.com/recipe/ikarian-longevity-stew-with-black-eyed-peas-recipe/) which I first read in the New York Times, but is available on the Blue Zones website. His recipe without a pressure cooker takes over 2 hours (an hour for soaking the beans and an hour of cooking), but this version takes under 1/2 hour, probably under 20 minutes.

Ingredients:

* 1/2 c extra virgin olive oil
* 1 large onion, loosely chopped into half moons
* 1 cup dried black eyed peas
* 1 large fennel bulb or 2 small ones loosely chopped
* 4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped<sup>1</sup>
* 2-3 bay leaves
* 2 tsp tomato paste<sup>1</sup>
* salt to taste

* 1 large ripe tomato
* 1 small bunch fresh dill

Instructions:

* Layer the ingredients minus the fresh tomato and dill in the bottom of your pressure cooker: extra virgin olive oil, onion, dried peas, chopped fennel, chopped garlic, bay leaves, tomato paste, optional salt, and cover with water so that the water is at least 2 cm above the peas. Bring to pressure, and pressure cook for 7 minutes. You can let it cool naturally or release pressure manually.

* Add fresh dill and fresh tomato and bring to a simmer for 3 minutes and serve. 

1. It's important not to add too much garlic or too much tomato paste to this soup as it overpowers the delicate flavors of the fennel and dill.
