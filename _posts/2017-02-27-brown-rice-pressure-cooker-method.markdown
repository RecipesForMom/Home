Ingredients:

* 1 cup of brown rice
* 1.5 cup of water

Instructions:

* Add ingredients to pressure cooker.<sup>1</sup> Bring to pressure and turn down heat. Cook for 5 minutes. Let sit for 10 minutes before releasing pressure (or let pressure release naturally if you're busy).<sup>2</sup>

How to Scale:

Dan Souza of American's Test Kitchen and Cook's Illustrated [explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJFU7ezipbg) that without evaporation any type of rice (white, brown, red) and any amount of rice should be cooked with a one-to-one (by volume) ratio of water to rice. (He tests this with sous-vide.) Recipes require larger amounts of water for brown rice compared to white because brown rice takes longer to cook and so more evaporation occurs. Moreover, you can increase or decrease the amount of rice in your recipe just by taking a one-to-one ratio of water to rice and adding in the extra amount of water that you need for evaporation. The amount that you need for evaporation depends on the cooking time (e.g. brown vs. white) and the pot you are using, not the amount of rice you are cooking. So, in this example, the amount of water needed for evaporation is 1.5 - 1 = 0.5 cup. If you wanted to make 2 cups of rice, the amount of water you would need is 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 cup water.

1. A small pressure cooker reaches pressure faster. I use my grandmother's 5 quart and an [Indian 3 liter by Hawkins.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MPQH8U/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
2. The rice will look a bit wet when you open the lid. Stir and the excess moisture will evaporate.
