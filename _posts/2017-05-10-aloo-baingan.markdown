This dish is called: Potato, Eggplant, Green Pepper. It is inspired by [Manjula's Kitchen's Aloo Baingan.](http://www.manjulaskitchen.com/aloo-baingan-potato-and-eggplant/) Also, check out her [YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/user/Manjulaskitchen) It is where I learned to cook Indian food.<sup>1</sup>

The recipe is a variation on my ["Curried Anything: Cheater's Method Version 1"]({% post_url 2017-05-29-curried-anything %}) with the additional spice paprika.

I will soon post an oven free version where all vegetables are pressure cooked together. It is less tasty, but is quick and cooler if you're cooking in the summer heat. 

Ingredients:
* 1 eggplant or a few little ones cubed
* 3 small potatoes cubed
* 1 or 2 green bell peppers (or sub spicy peppers of your choice)

* 2 inches fresh ginger [peeled]({% post_url 2017-05-09-how-to-peel-ginger %})
* 5 cloves garlic [peeled]({% post_url 2017-05-09-how-to-peel-garlic %})
* 3 small tomatoes
* 1 green chili or 1/2 tsp red cayenne powder

* 1 tsp whole cumin seeds and oil to saut√©

* 1 tbsp coriander powder
* 1 tsp turmeric powder
* 1 tsp paprika
* salt to taste

* optional: cilantro to garnish

Instructions:
* Cube the vegetables (eggplant, potatoes, peppers), put in a baking dish, toss with olive oil and bake at 400 F, while you prep the sauce. (It will take 45 min to bake, but to me this is easier than frying the ingredients because they can cook while I do other things.)

* Put the tomatoes, garlic, ginger, chili and all of the spices minus the cumin (coriander, turmeric, paprika, cayenne powder) in the food processor to puree. Fry the cumin in oil. Add the spicy tomato puree, and cook until the oil comes to the top. Salt to taste. Add the roasted vegetables to the sauce when they are tender, and serve.

1. Note that Manjula practices the Jain religion, so she doesn't use garlic or onions, but subs Asafoetida (Hing), which you will have to get in a specialty Indian store in the US. You can just use garlic instead.
