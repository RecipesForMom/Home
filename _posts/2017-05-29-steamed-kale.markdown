Ingredients:

* 1 bunch kale

Instructions:

* Pull the leaves off of the thick stem of kale fronds with your hands. Wash and microwave with 1/4 c water in a microwave safe bowl with a plate over top for 2 minutes. Enjoy with some [garlic tahini sauce]({% post_url 2017-05-29-garlic-tahini-sauce %}) and nutritional yeast. Eating steamed kale with tahini and nooch are inspired by the kale served by a student run group that sells lunch on the University of Massachusetts campus near Earthfoods Cafe. (I can't remember the name of the group.)
