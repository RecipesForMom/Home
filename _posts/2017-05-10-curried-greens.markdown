This recipe is loosely inspired by [Nisha Madhulika's Sarson ka Saag.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re17lSewdy8) Sarson ka Saag is made of half mustard greens and half spinach. Kale was on sale at the store, so I used that. It's better with spinach and mustard greens. I prefer [creamy kale]({% post_url 2017-05-29-creamy-kale %}) or [steamed kale]({% post_url 2017-05-29-steamed-kale %}). 

The recipe is a variation on my ["Curried Anything: Cheater's Method Version 1"]({% post_url 2017-05-29-curried-anything %}) without coriander and with chickpea flour as a thickening agent for the sauce.

Ingredients:
* 2 bunches of kale or 1 bunch mustard greens, 1 bunch spinach

* 2 inches fresh ginger [peeled]({% post_url 2017-05-09-how-to-peel-ginger %})
* 5 cloves fresh garlic [peeled]({% post_url 2017-05-09-how-to-peel-garlic %})
* 3 small tomatoes
* 1 green chili or 1/2 tsp red cayenne powder (or more to taste)

* 1 tsp whole cumin seeds and oil for frying

* 1 tsp turmeric powder
* salt to taste
* 1/4 c chickpea flour (besan)<sup>1</sup>

* optional: 1 tbsp dried fenugreek leaves (methi)
* optional: cilantro to taste

Instructions:
* Wash greens and rip the leaves off of the thick stems with your hands (if using kale, else chop), putting all of the leaves in a big mixing bowl to microwave. Microwave for 2 minutes to reduce the size of your greens so it will fit in your pressure cooker. Add greens and a cup of water to pressure cooker, bring to pressure and turn off heat.<sup>2</sup> 

* Add ginger, garlic, tomato, and green chili and all of the spices minus the cumin (turmeric, red cayenne powder) to your food processor and puree. Cook cumin in oil in large frying pan for a minute. Add in the spicy tomato puree and saut√© until the oil comes to the top of the sauce. Add salt to taste. Add chickpea flour.

* Puree cooked greens in food processor and add it to the sauce. If you are adding fenugreek leaves or cilantro, add now. Mix well, heat thoroughly, and serve.

1. Sarson ka Saag uses finely ground cornmeal, but I prefer to use chickpea flour because it cooks more quickly. You don't have to go to a specialty store to get chickpea flour. You can get the Bob's Red Mill brand from Whole Foods. It comes up in Indian cooking a lot, so it won't go to waste if you cook more Indian food. 

2. If you have a big enough pressure cooker, you don't need to microwave your kale first.
