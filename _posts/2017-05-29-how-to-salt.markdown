You will notice that most of my recipes say "salt to taste" and treat salting food as an afterthought. That's partially because I didn't know any better and partially because I have a habit of cooking with no salt so that mom can add salt according to her preference for her blood pressure. 

Dan Souza of American's Test Kitchen and Cook's Illustrated [explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0v32jYkSi0) that it takes a long time for salt to penetrate food, especially vegetables, and the rate of penetration is increased by adding heat. Therefore, cooks often salt food early in the cooking process to get a uniformly salty taste. He also explains that if you salt food after it has cooked, you should add a fraction of the amount you would have added earlier to achieve the same taste because it hasn't absorbed into the food yet. 

I will most likely continue to salt at the end unless, as in the [Bibimbap recipe]({% post_url 2017-02-27-bibimbap %}) or when charring steak or salmon, I am adding salt early to draw the water out before cooking. This produces a home-style taste that's less professional, but we eat less salt overall and everyone at the table can customize their salt preference.
