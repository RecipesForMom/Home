Use greener cleaners. Best option: [Bon Ami](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Bon-Ami-04410-14oz-14-Oz-Bon-Ami-Cleanser-Case-of-12/26378949). Other options: [Washing Soda](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Arm-Hammer-Super-Washing-Soda-Detergent-Booster-Household-Cleaner-55-oz/19407690). Best option for a stained tub (and also stained pots and pans or burnt pans): [Bar Keeper's Friend](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Bar-Keeper-s-Friend-12-Oz-Cleaner-and-Polish/15026756). (Bar Keeper's friend is made of oxalic acid, which is the same natural chemical that spinach releases when cooked and that makes your teeth feel chalky. This stuff really works on a burnt, crusted pot, and on rust stains.)

Why use greener cleaners on your bathtub? You can get naked for your shower, sprinkle the scrubbing powder in the tub, step in and scrub, turn on the water (grab an old yogurt container to rise the tub) and shower and be done with it.<sup>1</sup> Compare this with using a harsher cleaner that you don't want to get on your body (e.g. Scrubbing Bubbles): you put on gloves, struggle to reach the crevices, have to change your clothes, and never clean the tub because it's too much work. 

1. Bon Ami is hypoallergenic. Washing Soda is strongly alkaline so if you have sensitive skin you might need to use gloves. Bar Keeper's Friend is acidic so if you have sensitive skin you might need to use gloves.
