The simplest answer is: don't.

The second best answer is: with a spoon. 

I learned the second answer from somebody's Quora post on kitchen tricks and it works very well. I learned the first answer from a comment Bhavna made in one of her cooking videos on [her YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SuperVeggieDelight), and I do this most of the time now. 

I buy quality organic ginger, break apart the nobs so that I can wash off all of the dirt, and grind it in the food processor rather than grate it to save time and spare my fingers.
