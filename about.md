When I'm cooking, I'm trying to get it done as fast as possible so I can get to the good part: eating. That's why it can be irritating when a food blogger waxes lyrical about how great the food is before you get to the recipe. I skip the verbiage, but wonder if I missed anything important (like the time I added a tablespoon of grated nutmeg to my Bolognese sauce because the NYT recipe listed a whole nutmeg under 'ingredients', only to require a light zest of it later in the instructions). 

So the principle of every recipe on this blog is to get to the point as quickly as possible. There are no long back stories to the recipes. Every essential ingredient is listed in the quantity required in the ingredients list. If the precise amount of an ingredient is not important, that flexibility is left to the chef. This is not the Joy of Cooking. You don't need your quarter teaspoon measure or three sauce pans. Whenever a simplification can be made in the order of operations so that you need less pans, it is made. Whenever a sacrifice can be made in the final presentation so that you need less pans or steps, it is made. Most people making dinner don't have a sou chef to prepare all of the ingredients ahead of time, so the operations are listed assuming that you are working on the next step while the current one is processing (e.g. chopping the tomato while the onion sautÃ©s).

This blog is written for my mom, for her appreciation, but also for her health. Therefore, many recipes are heavy on vegetables, some are vegetarian, some are vegan. (See the respective tags to isolate these.) Vegetables take time to clean and chop. I haven't found a way around this. Whenever possible, I will use a food processor to grate or puree, and a microwave or pressure cooker to cook. I love my pressure cooker. If you don't use one, you are missing out on a great benefit of the recipe. The whole Indian sub-continent is using pressure cookers in all ranges of sizes very effectively for cooking everything from dals and pulses to rice. The pressure cooker saves you time and preserves nutrients in food. Stop fearing it.

Many recipes on this blog are simplifications of recipes from other (reputable) sites. Credit is given where it is due.

I learned an important concept from the blog [Dad Cooks Dinner](https://www.dadcooksdinner.com/): after dinner cooking. The idea is that when you get home from work, you're too tired and hungry to cook a healthy meal. Therefore, you should cook tomorrow's dinner after you eat dinner tonight. This sounds labor intensive. The recipes listed under this tag are ones that take a long time to cook, but are relatively less labor intensive. They are slow cooker meals, or oven roasted meals that take > 1.5 hours to cook but < 0.5 hours to prep. 

I also have strong opinions on how to minimally clean your house, what products to use, etc. so there is a tag for that, too.
